Tracts is a set of classes and definitions used to model migration histories based on ancestry tracts in admixed individuals. Time-dependent gene-flow from multiple populations can be modeled. Because of the high number of degrees of freedom, it is prefereable to choose parameterized families of models and optimize parameters. 

Examples contains sample hapmap data and scripts to analyze them, including two different gene flow models.
