Installation: 

Copy all files and folders locally (See "Download zip") on the github repository page)

"tracts.py" is a python module. All its functions can be used from the python interpreter or ipython after it has been imported. It should work out-of-the-box once you have python, and numpy, pylab, scipy installed. 

If you are an academic, I recommend installing the Anaconda (https://store.continuum.io/cshop/academicanaconda) distribution. Make sure not to pay for it! Click Anaconda Academic License; it should be free for those with edu e-mail addresses."
